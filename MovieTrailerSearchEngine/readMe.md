# 🎬 Movie Trailer Search (React)

This project lets you search for movie trailers and details in two ways:

1. **Library Method** – using the [`movie-trailer`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/movie-trailer) npm package with `react-player`.
2. **API Method** – using the official [TMDB API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3) to fetch trailers and movie details.
